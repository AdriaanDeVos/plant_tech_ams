# Preparing for the Make Event

Makers that are well prepared get the most out of their experience. Before you attend your Make Day, there are a couple of activities to complete. Please walk through the steps below and make sure to have a working system before the actual Make session starts. It should only take about 15 minutes!

## Step 1 - Arduino IDE

Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software). Alternatively you can use [Micropython](https://github.com/OfferZen-Make/plant_tech_ams#micropython-submitted-by-michiel-erasmus)

## Step 2 - Set up your system

We will begin by installing the ESP8266 (that thingy in your box with the micro-USB port) support for the Arduino IDE:

- Open the Arduino IDE
- Go to Files (for Windows) or Arduino (for Mac) > Preferences
- Copy this: http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
- Paste it in the 'Additional Boards Managers URLs' field
- Click OK and close the preferences window
- Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager...
- Navigate to esp8266 by esp8266 community and install the software for Arduino.

## Step 3 - Connect your ESP8266

Now it's time to plug the ESP8266 board in your computer, and see how to blink an LED (the Hello World in the electronics):

- Navigate to Tools > ESP8266 Boards (2.7.4) > NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)
- Select the right USB port from Tools > Port
- Clone (or download, or simply copy-paste to your Arduino IDE window) the [BlinkESP](https://github.com/OfferZen-Make/plant_tech_ams/blob/master/BlinkESP.ino) code and run it in Arduino IDE by clicking 'Upload'.
- After compiling and uploading, the LED on your ESP8266 board should start flashing. You did it!

### Troubleshooting

All project troubleshooting is here https://github.com/OfferZen-Make/plant_tech_ams/wiki

## Step 4 - Take a photo of your setup and share it!

[ðŸ“¸  -> Share a photo of your setup on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=&text=I'm%20setup%20and%20ready%20to%20go%20for%20my%20%23offerzenmake%20event%20with%20%40offerzen!)

Here's a fabulous example from @hendrikdelarey

If you don't have Twitter you can share it on LinkedIn. Steps:
* Copy this message: `I'm setup and ready to go for my #offerzenmake event with @offerzen! `.
* Upload a photo of your setup and the message above to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/).

Do both if you're a super star ðŸŒŸ

And if you abhor all social medias and don't do any of that then please share it on the #project-arduino-plant channel in Slack ðŸ˜‚

Thank you, it really helps to keep the lights on ðŸ’¡. See you soon <3

## Step 5 - Chart a course for self-watering plant mastery

Read through the [Plant Tech readme](https://github.com/OfferZen-Make/plant_tech_ams/blob/master/README.md) including [project extensions](https://github.com/OfferZen-Make/plant_tech_ams/blob/master/README.md#project-extensions), [community contributions](https://github.com/OfferZen-Make/plant_tech_ams/blob/master/README.md#community-contributions) and [useful resources](https://github.com/OfferZen-Make/plant_tech_ams/blob/master/README.md#useful-resources) to get an idea for where you want to take your self-watering plant project on the evening of the event.

Please edit or add to the docs as you go!
