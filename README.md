## Before the event
We're excited to have you join this course, where you'll be working with plants, Arduino boards, moisture sensors and watering systems. The aim of Make Days is to explore and learn new things. You don't need to achieve specific goals. The structure caters for varying levels of experience; different Makers will learn different things by playing with the same tools!

### Preparing for the Make Event

**üëâ Before the event, complete the [Make Preparation Manual](https://github.com/OfferZen-Make/plant_tech_ams/blob/master/PREP.md) to get your LED blinking and ensure you are setup for the event.**

Please see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) if you run into issues.

## At the event

### Bring your own

* Tall glass or container with water to test the sensor and water pump

### Part 1 - Set up your plant üå±

#### üá≥üá± Netherlands Teams

Add 300 ml water to the bag with pressed soil, forming ~1 liter of compost. Make a few small (1cm deep) holes in the soil and place the basil seeds in them, covering with a bit of loose soil.

#### üáøüá¶ South African Teams
- Fill your pot most of the way with soil
- Sprinkle your seeds on top
- Cover with ¬±1 cm soil

### Part 2 - Moisture Sensor üí¶

Connect the moisture sensor with the LM393 chip that comes in the same pack. The sensor has both an analog (0 for wet and 1023 for dry) and a digital (LOW for wet and HIGH for dry) output. Check the pinout for the sensor above and see where it would connect to the ESP8266 board (tip: it has an analog, digital, GND, and needs a voltage).

<img src="https://www.circuitstoday.com/arduino-soil-moisture-sensor/pin-out" alt="moisture" width="500"/>

Connect the ESP8266 with your PC and start up the Arduino IDE. Sometimes the ESP8266 does not show in your IDE. If so, look for the right USB-port (Tools > Port).

<img src="https://i2.wp.com/randomnerdtutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ESP8266-NodeMCU-kit-12-E-pinout-gpio-pin.png?ssl=1" alt="ESP8266" width="400"/>

Try writing a little programme to print the sensor's moisture values (analog is more interesting here as it gives you a value from a wetness-range). If coding isn't your strong suit, you can use the code provided in this repo for the [Moisture Sensor](https://github.com/OfferZen-Make/plant_tech_ams/blob/master/MoistureSensor.ino).

Upload your code to your system, wait untill the upload is done - the terminal should read: "Leaving... Hard resetting via RTS pin..." - and open the monitor (Tools > Serial Monitor) to see your printed values. Make sure that the Baud rate in the program and your serial monitor window are the same. If you used the code from the repo above, select the 115200 BAUD option for upload speed, otherwise your readings are not printed.

Put your sensor (only the two large exposed pads) in the compost of your plant, or simply put it in a glass of water, to do some readings!

### Part 3 - Mini Water Pump ‚õΩÔ∏è

The pump is water submersible, sucks in water from the hole on the opposite end of the wires, and pumps it through the little outlet. In order to switch the pump on and off, it needs to be connected to the ESP8266 with the TIP31C Transistor. Use the connector (white block with four inlets) to do so. The two wires of the pump go in one side, the other side takes your Dupont wires. By gently pulling off the plastic bit of one side of the Dupont wire, exposing the metal, you can put it in the other side of the connector.

<img src="Submersible Pump Pinout.png" alt="pump" width="300"/> <img src="https://www.componentsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tip31c-pinout-equivalent.gif" alt="tip31c" width="300"/>

The pump has a GND output to be connected to the ESP8266 and receives power from the emitter pin of the transistor. The transistor gets its power through its collector pin from the ESP8266's 3V3 pin. Finally, connect the base to the D6 pin to be able to control the pump.

Write some code (or check the code from the [complete watering system](https://github.com/OfferZen-Make/plant_tech_ams/blob/master/plant_watering_system.ino) in this repo) to get the pump up and running. Before uploading the code, make sure to submerse the pump in your tall glass/container filled with water, as you do not want to overheat its motor - and please watch out for water spills ;)

### Part 4 - Time to play! ü•≥

Now that the basics of your system are up and running, it's time to play around a bit! You can put your moisture sensor in your plant and attach the PVC tubing to the water pump (potentially use the cable tie to prevent leaking) with one end, and lay the other end in the plant.

See what analog value would be a good threshhold of dryness. Implement this in your code to start activating your pump as soon as this threshold is reached. Also try to implement some delays in your code to stop the pump after a few seconds, as it takes some time for the soil to get moist and the sensor to pick this up.

If you are confident that your very own automated watering system is fully working, you can check out the repos below for some inspiration on how to communicate with your system via your phone :)

### Set up a web server

Example
https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-dht11dht22-temperature-and-humidity-web-server-with-arduino-ide/

Important: if you want to use the ESP8266 WEB Server in this example you will need to downloand the following two libraries. These libraries are not available in the library manager.

#### Installing the ESPAsyncWebServer library
The ESPAsyncWebServer library is not available to install in the Arduino IDE Library Manager. So, you need to install it manually.

Follow the next steps to install the ESPAsyncWebServer library:

https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer/archive/master.zip

Unzip the .zip folder and you should get ESPAsyncWebServer-master folder
Rename your folder from ESPAsyncWebServer-master to ESPAsyncWebServer
Move the ESPAsyncWebServer folder to your Arduino IDE installation libraries folder

#### Installing the ESPAsync TCP Library
The ESPAsyncWebServer library requires the ESPAsyncTCP library to work. Follow the next steps to install that library:

https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP/archive/master.zip

Unzip the .zip folder and you should get ESPAsyncTCP-master folder
Rename your folder from ESPAsyncTCP-master to ESPAsyncTCP
Move the ESPAsyncTCP folder to your Arduino IDE installation libraries folder
Finally, re-open your Arduino IDE

### RGB LED
Extend you project with an [RGB LED](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/how-to-use-a-rgb-led-with-arduino/) to indicate moisture levels with colors.

## Troubleshooting


### USB port not showing in Tools > Port
- If your USB port does not show up in Tools > Port, you may need the driver.
  - If your board has a square chip next to the USB port then use [this driver](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) for the usb-uart. (CP2102 Chipset)
  - If your board has a rectangular chip next to the USB port then use [this driver](https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html) for the usb-uart. (CH340 Chipset)
  - When that doesn't solve the problem, (this seems to happen when using a MacBook with an USB-C adapter) check this [forum](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/334311/connection-of-esp32-esp8266-not-recognized-using-macbook-pro).
  - If you're still stuck, let us know in the Slack Channel so we can help you get it to work!

### "Fatal Error Failed to connect"
If you see a `Fatal Error Failed to connect to ESP8266: Timed out waiting for packet header` (this might not happen on the first time but in subsequent uploads): disconnect the external board and upload again, connecting the wires after this. [Reference](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/issues/490).
  - For some people this does not work, as an alternative, you need to force the label (D4) to a [low state](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-pinout-reference-gpios/), or maybe use a different label. To do this follow these steps:
  
#### Booting into program mode
1. press and hold the "RST" button
2. press and hold the "FLASH" button
3. release the "RST" button, the ESP will boot in program mode
4. release the program button
5. upload the sketch


### Struggling to connect to Wifi

The Arduino's Wifi antenna is very small and not very strong, so you might need to move it closer to the Wifi.

You can use [this program](https://github.com/OfferZen-Make/plant_tech_ams/blob/master/examples/WiFi/list_wifi.ino) to find SSID's and check signal strength.

### Mac users unable to get your Hello World up and running

Solution submitted by Alex Siega

1. Under Tools > Board, make sure to select "Generic ESP8266 Module." Mine defaults to "Arduino Uno" without actively selecting the right board.
2. Install the drivers from the OfferZen Prep page. Make sure to give the drivers the correct permissions in the Security & Privacy area in System Preferences; it's at the end of the "General" tab.
3. In Tools > Port, select /dev/cu.usbserial-1420 at the port. (No mention of "right" USB port, but hey, it works! :smile:)
4. Last step -- when you go to upload blinkESP.ino, you may get a 'D4' was not declared in this scope error. Change D4 to 2 , making the first line # define LED 2

This results in a blue light flashing every second, which I believe is the "hello world" described in the prep document!

Paolo Brizzolari > @Alex Siega it‚Äôs cool that you got it working. Just a couple of points:

Using the generic 8266 doesn‚Äôt guarantee that all the pins will have the right numbers so I‚Äôd advise choosing the NodeMCU board once you‚Äôve added the json url to the boards manager
The alias D4 that disappeared was because of the above. For each board there is an import happening in the background
If you check the esp8266 libraries you can go into variants/nodemcu/pins_arduino.h [and see the following](https://github.com/OfferZen-Make/plant_tech_ams/blob/master/snippets/pins_arduino.h).

### Mac OSX: Big Sur upload errors

If when trying to upload a sketch to your board you get the following error, then try the steps below.

**pyserial or esptool directories not found next to this upload.py tool.

1. Open ~/Library/Arduino15/packages/esp8266/hardware/esp8266/2.7.4/tools/pyserial/serial/tools/list_ports_osx.py
2. Comment out lines 29 and 30 and append these lines:
```
iokit = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary('/System/Library/Frameworks/IOKit.framework/IOKit')
cf = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary('/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/CoreFoundation')
```

If the error is still occurring.
1. Edit ~/Library/Arduino15/packages/esp8266/hardware/esp8266/2.7.4/tools/esptool/esptool.py
2. Find the block of code below and comment it out by adding # to the start of each line:
```
#try:
#    import serial.tools.list_ports as list_ports
#except ImportError:
#    print("The installed version (%s) of pyserial appears to be too old for esptool.py (Python interpreter %s). "
#          "Check the README for installation instructions." % (sys.VERSION, sys.executable))
#    raise
```

### Windows: USB Driver issues

**Problem**
Can‚Äôt seem to find any that work for me. The ones recommended on the guide don‚Äôt help and the ‚Äúport‚Äù option stays grayed out in the arduino ide.

**Solution - Adam Hillier**
I had the same issue. I installed the driver from here: https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html. It worked for me.

### My pump isn't working

Try connect it to a 3V+ battery to test it.
