# Plant Tech ðŸŒ±

We're excited to have you join this course, where you'll be working with plants, Arduino boards, moisture sensors and watering systems.

The aim of Make Days is to explore and learn new thing. You don't need to achieve specific goals. The structure caters for varying levels of experience and different Makers will learn different things by playing with the same tools.

# Preparing for the Make Day

Makers that arrive well prepared get the most out of their experience. Before you attend your Make Day, there are a couple of activities to complete.

## Prep

Here's a list of things you'll need to prep before you can set up your biltong maker. 

- Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
- Read the [Quick Start to Nodemcu (ESP8266) on Arduino IDE](https://www.instructables.com/id/Quick-Start-to-Nodemcu-ESP8266-on-Arduino-IDE/)

Important: if you want to use the ESP8266 WEB Server in this example you will need to downloand the following two libraries. These libraries are not available in the library manager.

### Installing the ESPAsyncWebServer library
The ESPAsyncWebServer library is not available to install in the Arduino 
Library Manager. So, you need to install it manually.

Follow the next steps to install the ESPAsyncWebServer library:

https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer/archive/master.zip

Unzip the .zip folder and you should get ESPAsyncWebServer-master folder
Rename your folder from ESPAsyncWebServer-master to ESPAsyncWebServer
Move the ESPAsyncWebServer folder to your Arduino IDE installation libraries folder

### Installing the ESPAsync TCP Library
The ESPAsyncWebServer library requires the ESPAsyncTCP library to work. Follow the next steps to install that library:

https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP/archive/master.zip

Unzip the .zip folder and you should get ESPAsyncTCP-master folder
Rename your folder from ESPAsyncTCP-master to ESPAsyncTCP
Move the ESPAsyncTCP folder to your Arduino IDE installation libraries folder
Finally, re-open your Arduino IDE

You may also need [the driver](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) for the usb-uart
