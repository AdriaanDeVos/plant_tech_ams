# Plant Kids 🌱🧒🏻🧒🏿🧒🏼🧒🏾🧒🏽🌱

*Please contribute to this file :)*

Having kids participate with their parents in Make events is really great. Kids are excellent at diving into challenges without pause and can really help bring a mindset of curiosity and ideation into a session. For this reason please consider getting your kids involved in the event, see ideas below.

## Ideas for getting kids involved in Make events.

- For starters just invite them to join the video call and ask questions.
- They might enjoy connecting the kit, while you focus on the software - or vice versa!
- Perhaps they'd like to create a container for your self-watering plant and the electronics? Here are some ideas

Otherwise explain to them what the event is about and ask them how we could make it more fun - they have amazing ideas!
